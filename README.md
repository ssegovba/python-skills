# Python projects
Programming projects developed during Computer Science with Applications course - Fall 2022. Core programming class from the MS in Computational Analysis and Public Policy (MSCAPP) program at The University of Chicago.  

1. [Modeling Epidemics](https://classes.cs.uchicago.edu/archive/2022/fall/30121-1/pa/pa1/index.html) - basics of Python, translate simple algorithms into code
2. [Modeling Language Shifts](https://classes.cs.uchicago.edu/archive/2022/fall/30121-1/pa/pa2/index.html) - nested loops, lists of lists, and functions
3. [Analyzing Candidate Tweets](https://classes.cs.uchicago.edu/archive/2022/fall/30121-1/pa/pa3/index.html) - dictionaries as a way to represent data
4. [Polling places](https://classes.cs.uchicago.edu/archive/2022/fall/30121-1/pa/pa4/index.html) - designing and implementing classes and methods
5. [Linear Regression](https://classes.cs.uchicago.edu/archive/2022/fall/30121-1/pa/pa5/index.html) - NumPy, classes and functions to support code reuse
6. [Visualizing Avian Biodiversity Using Treemaps](https://classes.cs.uchicago.edu/archive/2022/fall/30121-1/pa/pa6/index.html) - recursive data structures and functions
